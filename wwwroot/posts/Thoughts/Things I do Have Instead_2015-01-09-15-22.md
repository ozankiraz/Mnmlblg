After I wrote my last post, things I don’t have that many do, someone asked, “What do you have that most people don’t?”
It was a good question. I cut out a lot of what I found to be unnecessary (for me) to make room for what I find to be more important.
So what do I have instead? Honestly, what I have isn’t that uncommon, but here goes:

   * leisure time
   * space in my home
   * time to read, meditate, exercise
   * time to write every day
   * time for my beautiful family
   * time for close friends
   * time to walk places (instead of drive)
   * freedom from car maintenance, car breakdowns, traffic
   * time to cook simple, healthy meals
   * the luxury of not worrying what time it is most of the time
   * disconnectedness when I’m away from home
   * fewer distractions even when I’m connected
   * my health
   * less worry
   * a very light packing list
   * worry-free finances
   * a business I’m proud of
   * wonderful readers
