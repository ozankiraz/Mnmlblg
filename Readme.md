# Mnmlblg
Personal Blog Inspired By Minimalism
I inspired by http://mnmlist.com/ and https://github.com/alliswell/Less
original themes was designed for wordpress, and I thought I could make it more "Minimalist"

Mnmlblg is personal blog coded with Asp.Net core

* No comments
* Less theme by Jared Erickson : https://github.com/alliswell/Less
* Most of the things listed here : http://mnmlist.com/w/
* Rss feed for posts

and also it was a good excuse to learn MVC / Asp.net core as pure backend guy :)
